CLEANSER is a gRNA-cell assignment method that uses a mixture of two distinct distributions to model ambient and native gRNA presence in perturb-seq CRISPR libraries. CLEANSER takes into account gRNA-specific and cell-specific biases and generates a probability value of whether or not a gRNA is expressed natively in a cell.
